👋 Hi there, I am Umme Kulsum Surovi, currently pursuing my BSc (Engg.) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Asia Pacific (UAP).

👩🏼‍💻 I am currently immersing myself in the world of WordPress and front-end web development, crafting virtual landscapes that seamlessly blend aesthetics and functionality.

💼 I am passionate about the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship.

🎵 Amidst lines of code and business models, you'll find me expressing my soul through melodies, for singing is not just a hobby but an integral part of who I am.
